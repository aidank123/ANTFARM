ToDo: Right now the ants are generally moving away from places explored by other ants by choosing randomly from the adjacent spaces which have the lowest home_pheremone_levels. This is the pheromone that is released as they try to search for food. They are getting stuck in local maximums, so I will add some factor that randomizes higher the more explored spaces they are near?
