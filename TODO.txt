ToDo: 

----Right now the ants are super prone to getting stuck. Ants that have food get stuck trying to get home using overly simple, non-randomized pathing. Ants that are looking for food will follow those ants because they are dropping food pheromones. They all group together in this manner. 

	-the randomness range factor definitely helps with this. Ants move a lot more randomly and
 	don't get stuck in local maximums.

	-the smelling radius also seems to help them see outside of these local minimums.
