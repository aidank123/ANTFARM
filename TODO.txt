ToDo: 


----Right now the ants are super prone to getting stuck. Ants that have food get stuck trying to get home using overly simple, non-randomized pathing. Ants that are looking for food will follow those ants because they are dropping food pheromones. They all group together in this manner. 


--I have given them the information of where the food is and where the hive is in order to have them choose better options. This is not really the model I had in mind and I will make improvements to these factors:

	-accurate pheromone models

	-better local searching(more random) (try simulated annealing?)
		--ants are so prone to getting stuck in local maximums right now
