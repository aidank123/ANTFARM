ToDo: 


----Right now the ants are super prone to getting stuck. Ants that have food get stuck trying to get home using overly simple, non-randomized pathing. Ants that are looking for food will follow those ants because they are dropping food pheromones. They all group together in this manner. 

This is not an accurate model and will need to be updated to represent nature better using:

	
	-accurate pheromone models

	-better local searching(more random) (try simulated annealing)
		--ants are so prone to getting stuck in local maximums right now
